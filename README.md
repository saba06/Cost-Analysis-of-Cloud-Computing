# Cost-Analysis-of-Cloud-Computing
You	are	hired	by	a	startup	company	who	is	considering	to	use	cloud	computing	instead	of	building	its	own	infrastructure.	
There	is	concensus	that	a	cloud	computing	software	stack	at	the	layer	of	IaaS	will	be	used,	
but	its	not	clear	whether	the	computing	resources	should	be	rented	from	a	public	cloud	on-demand,	
or	whether	a	private	cloud	should	be	purchased.	You	are	tasked	to	find	the	cost	breakdown	of	a	private	cloud,	
and	compare	that	to	what	Amazon	would	charge	for	the	following	instance	types:	t2.small,	m3.large,	c3.8xlarge,	g2.2xlarge,	
r3.4xlarge,	i2.8xlarge,	and	d2.8xlarge
